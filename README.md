# JavaScript Auth0 Login Boilerplate #

This is a login boilerplate that I made using Auth0. I used
[Auth0 ReactJS Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/interactive) to help get me started.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Do everything in step one of the [Auth0 ReactJS Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/interactive)

## Setup
- Run the following commands in your terminal

```angular2html
git clone git@github.com:jakeMartin1234/auth0-login-boilerplate.git
cd auth0-login-boilerplate
npm install
cp sample.env .env
```
- Populate your newly created .env file with your Client ID and Domain from your Auth0 application.
- Run the following command in your terminal
```angular2html
npm start
```
